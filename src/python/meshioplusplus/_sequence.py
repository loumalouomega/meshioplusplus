"""Multi-file / transient datasets: a *set* of files (or the steps inside one
multi-step file) treated as one ordered logical sequence.

This is how transient solver output actually arrives -- ``out_0000.vtu …
out_0500.vtu`` -- and how most of the 42 formats have to express time, since
only a minority carry several steps natively.

It is a **driver, not a new operation**. Everything here reads and writes
through the public ``read``/``write`` and runs operation chains through
``_pipeline``'s existing step dispatch, so the settings vocabulary has exactly
one owner. Like ``_pipeline.run_pipeline``, this is a pure-Python twin of the
C++ engine (``operations/sequence.hpp``): it dispatches over the public Python
API, which is what gives it the per-format Python fallbacks the C++ driver
lacks. The two are pinned against each other by ``tests/python/test_sequence.py``.

Three shapes, inferred from how many files the input expands to and whether the
output path carries a ``{step}``/``{index}`` token:

``fan-out``
    one multi-step file -> ``out_{step}.vtu``. The answer for every format that
    cannot express time, which is most of them.
``fan-in``
    N single-step files -> one multi-step file (XDMF today).
``sequence``
    N files -> N files, with the operation chain applied per step.

**The streaming invariant.** ``read_sequence`` is a generator and yields exactly
one live ``Mesh`` per iteration; ``write_sequence`` and
``run_sequence_pipeline`` read step *i*, write step *i*, and release it. Nothing
here holds the sequence in memory -- that is a contract, not an optimization,
because the whole feature exists so a 500-step dataset is traversable on a
laptop. ``tests/python/test_sequence.py`` pins it with weak references rather
than trusting the prose.
