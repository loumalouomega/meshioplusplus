"""The provenance record every writer renders into its own header slot.

Two layers. ``TAG`` (v10.15.0) is the unconditional one-line credit: always
emitted, by both engines, character-identically. Nothing about it changed
here.

The ``Record``/``scope`` surface (v10.16.0) is the **opt-in** richer block --
source, target, the operation chain and the conversion assumptions accepted
on the way. ``Mode.OFF`` is the default, so a caller who asks for nothing
gets byte-for-byte what v10.15.0 wrote.

This is the Python twin of ``detail/provenance.hpp`` -- the C++ header's own
doc comment explains *why* a scoped context rather than growing an existing
options struct (``WriteOptions``/``write`` kwargs bypass most write paths
entirely) and *why* thread-local rather than process-global (concurrent
writes must not cross-contaminate). Both apply here unchanged; Python's
``threading.local`` is the direct analogue of C++'s ``thread_local``.

Deliberately **not** carrying which engine rendered the file: the roadmap
asks for that diagnostic, but it contradicts the harder guarantee that the
C++ core and the Python fallback emit character-identical bytes -- an engine
marker is exactly the ``(C++ core)``-vs-``v{version}`` drift v10.15.0
removed. It is reported through :func:`current_record` instead, where it
costs nothing (see :func:`meshioplusplus._core.<fmt>_write`'s callers, which
set it before delegating to the C++ engine).
