"""The training spec and run-directory layout: the pure half of the trainer.

Everything here is stdlib + numpy and Python 3.8 -- the spec parser, the run
layout, the metrics/progress files, the model card -- so it is tested in the
default CI matrix with no framework installed. ``train.py`` (the module run
as ``python -m meshioplusplus.physicsnemo.train``) is the only place torch,
PhysicsNeMo and PyTorch Geometric are imported.

**The spec is a hand-editable input, so it is a settings-family document**
(PascalCase keys, ``"Version": 1``, strict unknown-key refusal -- the
``DatasetManifest``/pipeline convention); everything a run *writes*
(``job.json``, ``progress.json``, ``metrics.jsonl``, ``*.card.json``) is a
machine artefact and is snake_case (the ``write_dataset`` precedent).

Run directory layout (``RunDir``)::

    spec.json           the spec the run was started from (PascalCase)
    job.json            written by the job manager (mcp/_jobs.py), not here
    progress.json       {epoch, epochs, best_epoch, best_valid_loss, ...}
    metrics.jsonl       one JSON object per epoch
    log.txt             stdout+stderr of the trainer (the manager redirects)
    node_stats.json     the PhysicsNeMo-convention normalization stats
    edge_stats.json
    checkpoints/        <Model>.0.<epoch>.mdlus + checkpoint.0.<epoch>.pt
                        (physicsnemo's save_checkpoint), best.mdlus,
                        final.mdlus -- every .mdlus with a .card.json sidecar
    predictions/        <entry_id>.vtu written by predict()

The **model card** (``<checkpoint>.card.json``, the Kratos
PhysicsNeMoApplication convention) records what a checkpoint's channels
mean -- field names, column order, the normalization the model was trained
under -- so a prediction can never silently write normalized numbers onto a
physical field.
