"""Per-vertex mean and Gaussian curvature of a surface, by the standard
discrete estimators: the angle defect for ``K`` and the cotangent
Laplace-Beltrami operator for ``H``.

These are the estimators the discrete-differential-geometry literature's
convergence results are about, and the ones NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo's own
``gaussian_curvature_vertices``/``mean_curvature_vertices`` use, so the numbers
here are comparable with a model's. Curvature is the signed distance's natural
companion as a node feature: :func:`meshioplusplus.sample_distance` says how
far a point is from the surface, this says how the surface bends there.

**Deliberately NOT** :func:`meshioplusplus.remesh`'s estimator, which fits an
osculating paraboloid over each 1-ring to drive its own gradation and
anisotropic metric. That one returns only the larger-magnitude principal
curvature as a *magnitude*, runs on remesh's subdivided working copy rather
than the caller's mesh, and has no structural invariant to test against. It is
left exactly as it is; this is a second, independent estimator.

**The oracle is Gauss-Bonnet.** For a closed surface the angle defects sum to
``2*pi*chi`` -- ``4*pi`` for a sphere -- whatever the tessellation and
whichever dual area. The result carries that sum as ``total_angle_defect``
precisely so the invariant is checkable from every binding and not only from a
gtest.

**``H`` is orientation-dependent and ``K`` is not.** The mean curvature's sign
comes from the surface's own winding, so a mesh whose facets disagree about
which side is out yields sign-flipped patches with no error raised. That is why
the report carries the input's ``quality``: check ``quality["inconsistent_pairs"]``
before trusting a sign. This operation never silently repairs its input.

### Where byte-parity stops

``dual_area="barycentric"`` is branch-free -- every vertex gets a third of each
incident triangle's area -- so this module implements it as a genuine numpy
twin of the C++ core and ``tests/python/test_curvature.py`` pins the two
against each other to a tight tolerance (not exact equality: the one
``atan2`` in the angle-defect computation goes through ``std::atan2`` on the
C++ side and numpy's vectorized ``arctan2`` on the Python side, and those two
transcendental-function implementations carry no cross-library bit-exactness
guarantee -- measured at up to ~1e-14 relative difference on some platforms).

``dual_area="mixed-voronoi"`` (the default) is not twinned and **raises**
:class:`NotImplementedError`: its obtuse/non-obtuse test is a discrete branch
on a sign, so two implementations could land on opposite sides for a
right-angled triangle and then disagree macroscopically rather than in the last
ulp -- exactly the case ``_smooth.py`` refuses for its inversion guard and
``_sdf.py`` for ``sign="winding-number"``. The raise only fires when the
compiled core is genuinely unavailable.
