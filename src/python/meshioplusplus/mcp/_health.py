"""Dataset health: the server-side producer of the per-entry / per-manifest
summary the browser dataset manager otherwise computes from its own WASM
scans (doc/dashboard.md).

Pure stdlib + meshioplusplus, Python 3.8 -- tested in the default matrix with
no optional extra. The shape is a superset of the browser's ``EntryScan`` /
``ManifestHealth`` (``src/viewer/src/dataset/types.ts``), snake_cased, so the
page's ``health.ts:fromServerHealth`` fills the same structure and the card
renderer takes either producer.

One rule is load-bearing and shared with the browser: a ``quality:*``
array's NaN means "metric N/A for this cell type" by design
(``compute_quality``'s own convention), so quality arrays are **excluded**
from the NaN/Inf counts. Meshes are read one at a time (the sequence
streaming invariant); a failing entry is reported, never fatal.
