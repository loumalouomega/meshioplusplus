/**
 * @file detail/surface_distance.hpp
 * @brief The signed-distance kernel: a triangle soup, its pseudonormal tables,
 * a bucket-grid accelerator, and the nearest-point query over them.
 *
 * `operations/sdf.cpp` is the driver; everything geometric lives here so that it
 * can be tested against closed-form distance fields with no grid, no mesh
 * generation and no binding in the way.
 *
 * ### The accelerator is deliberately not a BVH
 *
 * `detail/spatial_hash.hpp` already provides `InsertBox` (which exists precisely
 * to register a simplex's quantized bounding box) and `ForEachInShell` with a
 * documented stopping rule, and `interpolate.cpp` already runs an expanding-shell
 * nearest search over it. The workload here -- many queries against a
 * roughly uniform triangle soup -- is the uniform grid's best case and the BVH's
 * worst.
 *
 * The decisive reason, though, is not speed: **a BVH would make the accelerator
 * observable in the output.** Its build order and split heuristic determine the
 * order candidates are visited in, which determines which of two equidistant
 * triangles wins. The grid can be made provably unobservable instead, by giving
 * every comparison a total order -- `(distance squared, triangle id)` -- so that
 * the answer cannot depend on visit order at all. `SurfaceDistanceOptions`
 * exposes `mGridCellSize` mainly so a test can *prove* that: the same query at
 * several bucket sizes must return byte-identical distances and nearest cells.
 *
 * ### The sign
 *
 * `closest_point_on_triangle` reports which feature of the triangle the nearest
 * point lies on, and that selects the normal:
 *
 *  - face   -> the triangle's own normal;
 *  - edge   -> the sum of the two incident triangles' unit normals;
 *  - vertex -> the angle-weighted sum of the incident triangles' unit normals.
 *
 * Using the nearest *triangle's* normal in all three cases is the classic bug:
 * exactly right on convex geometry, exactly wrong on the concave side of every
 * crease, and it renders beautifully either way.
 *
 * Building those tables is the one place with a floating-point ordering hazard,
 * because summing unit normals in a non-deterministic order changes the last
 * bits and a last-bit change can flip a sign at a near-tangent query point. The
 * tables are therefore accumulated by a **serial** pass in ascending
 * (triangle, corner) order -- the phase-split idiom `surface.cpp` uses.

 * @brief The actual nearest POINT on the soup to each of @p rPoints, not just

 *
 * `query_distances`'s own `PointTriangleHit` already computes this internally
 * (`best_hit.mPoint`) and then discards it, keeping only the distance and the
 * sign -- which is all `sample_distance`/`distance_to_surface` ever needed.
 * `remesh_volume`'s warp step is the first caller that needs the point itself
 * (to move a lattice vertex onto the surface, not merely learn how far it
 * is), hence this sibling function rather than growing `DistanceHit`, whose
 * layout is an ABI boundary (`doc/abi.md`) this header already participates
 * in. Both functions share the identical bucket-grid nearest-triangle search
 * (`sd_nearest_triangle`, private to `surface_distance.cpp`) so they cannot
 * disagree about which triangle is nearest.
 *
 * No banding and no sign here -- a warp threshold is the caller's own
 * decision (`remesh_volume.cpp`'s own threshold, compared against
 * `mDistance` after the fact), and a warp target has no notion of inside or
 * outside to report.
 *
 * @param rQuery the accelerator built by `build_distance_query`.
 * @param rPoints the query points.
 * @return one hit per query point, `mFound == false` only when the soup this
 *         query was built from has no triangles (impossible in practice,
 *         since `build_distance_query` itself refuses an empty soup, but the
 *         field exists so a caller need not assume).
