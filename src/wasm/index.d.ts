 * A transient (time-series) XDMF writer: one static grid, then one `<Grid>`
 * per time step inside a temporal collection. Created by
 * {@link MeshioPlusPlusModule.createXdmfTimeSeriesWriter}.
 *
 * ## Why this one is a handle and not a function
 *
 * Every other binding in this package is a **stateless function** over a plain
 * mesh object: hand it values, get values back. A series cannot be that,
 * because its whole point is that the mesh is written **once** and each solve
 * appends a cheap step -- and because the `.xdmf` light data can only be
 * written when the collection is complete, since the collection element has to
 * enclose every step. So the object has to survive between calls.
 *
 * The raw embind surface for it is an **opaque integer handle plus free
 * functions** (`xdmfSeriesCreate`/`...WritePointsCells`/`...WriteData`/
 * `...Finalize`/`...NumSteps`/`...Finalized`/`...Free`), deliberately **not**
 * an embind `class_`, and this object is the wrapper's ergonomic face of it.
 * The reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 * 1. `@meshioplusplus/wasm` never hands JS a live C++ object -- `NDArray`,
 *    `CellBlock` and `Mesh` are all internal, and JS only ever sees plain
 *    objects of typed arrays. An embind `class_` instance would be the one
 *    exception, and would come with an Emscripten-specific `.delete()` that
 *    has no counterpart anywhere else in this API.
 * 2. Free functions all go through the same C++ error wrapper, so a
 *    `WriteError` arrives as a readable JS `Error`; a bound *member* function
 *    surfaces as a bare, message-less `WebAssembly.Exception`.
 * 3. It matches the C API (`mio_xdmf_series*`), so the two flat bindings
 *    describe the same object the same way.
 *
 * The handle is an index into a module-local table, not a raw pointer: a
 * stale or forged handle throws an `Error` instead of corrupting linear
 * memory.
 *
 * ## Getting the files out of MEMFS
 *
 * Nothing is on the virtual filesystem until `finalize()`/`close()` runs, and
 * **`'HDF'` produces TWO files**: the `.xdmf` at the path you gave, plus its
