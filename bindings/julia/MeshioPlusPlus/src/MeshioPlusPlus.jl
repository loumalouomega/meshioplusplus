    MeshioPlusPlus

Julia bindings for [meshio++](https://github.com/loumalouomega/meshioplusplus):
read and write ~40 mesh formats used in scientific computing and FEM, and run
meshio++'s operations layer on the meshes.

This package binds the **installed C API** (`libmeshioplusplus`), exactly as
the Fortran module does. Build and install it first:

```sh
./build/configure.sh --c-api --build
cmake --install build/cpp-release --prefix /your/prefix
```

then either put `/your/prefix/lib` on the loader path or set
`ENV["MESHIOPLUSPLUS_LIB"]` to the shared library before `using`.

# Two conventions

**Column-major.** Julia is column-major and the C core row-major, so points
shaped `(dim, num_points)` and connectivity `(nodes_per_cell, num_cells)` are
the *same memory* as the C API's `(num_points, dim)` and
`(num_cells, nodes_per_cell)`. Nothing is transposed anywhere.

**1-based.** Connectivity is 0-based at the ABI. The ±1 shift happens inside
the **copying** accessors only — [`connectivity`](@ref) is a 1-based copy,
[`connectivity_ptr`](@ref) the un-shifted zero-copy borrow. A borrow cannot be
shifted without copying it, which is the whole point of a borrow.

# Names that would shadow `Base`

`read`, `write`, `convert`, `merge`, `split` and `diff` are **not exported**.
Call them qualified:

```julia
import MeshioPlusPlus as mio
m = mio.read("bracket.msh")
mio.write(m, "bracket.vtu")
```
