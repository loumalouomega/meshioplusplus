# Named regions

A **region** is a named group of mesh entities. Every format that models one spells it differently — gmsh calls it a physical group, Exodus an element block or node set or side set, Abaqus an `*NSET` / `*ELSET` / `*SURFACE`, MED a family or group, UNV a group, Ansys a component, OpenFOAM a boundary patch, Kratos a SubModelPart — and converting between any two of them used to lose or mangle the grouping. `Region` is the one model they all map onto.

Before meshio++ 8.1 these lived only on the Python `Mesh`, as `point_sets` / `cell_sets`. They never crossed the pybind11 boundary, so the C API, Fortran, WebAssembly and the native CLI dropped them entirely, and each set-capable format smuggled them through its own side-channel struct. Regions close that gap.

## The model

```python
import meshioplusplus as mio

region = mio.Region("wall", "side", [[0, 1], [1, 3]], dim=2, tag=7)
```

| Field     | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `name`    | the group's name, as the originating format spelled it |
| `kind`    | `"point"`, `"cell"` or `"side"` — what `entries` indexes |
| `dim`     | the topological dimension the group was declared for, or `-1` if the format does not say |
| `tag`     | the format-native integer id (gmsh physical tag, MED family id, Exodus set id), or `-1` |
| `entries` | int64 indices — see below |

`dim` and `tag` exist because gmsh needs them: a physical group is *per-dimension*, two groups of different dimensions may share a name, and the integer tag is what a round-trip back to gmsh must restore. They are carried through conversion even by formats that have no use for them.

### The three kinds

**`"point"`** — entries are point indices, shape `(n,)`.

**`"cell"`** — entries are **global cell indices**, shape `(n,)`, numbered *block-major*: block 0's cells first, then block 1's, and so on. This is the same numbering [`partition_labels`](partition.md) uses for its flat buffer. `detail/cell_index.hpp` is the single owner of the conversion to and from `(block, row)`, so nothing re-derives it — the browser viewer's `_dimension_rows` counter bug (a running index that failed to advance over *skipped* blocks, so every per-cell quantity silently shifted) is the cautionary tale for what a second copy of that arithmetic costs.

**`"side"`** — entries are `(global cell index, local facet index)` pairs, shape `(n, 2)`. Facets are numbered exactly as `detail/cell_faces.hpp` numbers the faces of a 3-D cell and `detail/cell_edges.hpp` the edges of a 2-D one. **This kind has no equivalent in the legacy `point_sets`/`cell_sets` model at all** — it is only reachable through `.regions`.

### Canonical ordering

Entries are stored **ascending and de-duplicated** (lexicographically on the pair, for `"side"`). Two regions describing the same group are therefore bitwise equal, which is what makes the cross-format round-trip matrix an equality assertion rather than a set-comparison heuristic, and what makes region output byte-identical across the MESHIO / NATIVE / KRATOS backends and across thread counts.

The visible consequence: a group that survives an operation comes back **sorted**, not in whatever order the operation's permutation produced. Set semantics are what a named group means.

## Compatibility with `point_sets` / `cell_sets`

`mesh.point_sets` and `mesh.cell_sets` keep working exactly as they always have. They are now **views** over `mesh.regions`: reading one materializes the historical shape (a flat index array for `point_sets`, a per-block list of local index arrays for `cell_sets`), and writing one creates or replaces the matching regions.

```python
mesh.point_sets = {"fixed": [0, 3]}     # -> a "point" region
mesh.cell_sets["wall"] = [[0], [1, 2]]  # -> a "cell" region, global indices
mesh.regions                            # both, plus any side regions
```

The views are `dict` **subclasses**, not bare mappings, because plenty of code — including `numpy.testing.assert_equal` — branches on `isinstance(x, dict)`.

Two accommodations make the compat lossless rather than nearly so:

- **The passthrough escape hatch.** Formats stash things in `cell_sets` that are not cell indices at all: gmsh's `gmsh:bounding_entities` holds entity tags, orientation sign included. Such an entry cannot be a region, so it is kept verbatim in a private passthrough dict and returned unchanged. The test is *non-negative integers*, not "integers in range" — a negative value is the reliable tell (in the bundled `example.msh`, 475 of the 476 populated blocks contain one), while requiring every index to be in range would reject a genuine but sloppily-built cell set, which meshio has always accepted.
- **`None` blocks become empty arrays.** A `cell_sets` value may carry `None` for a block with no members (gmsh's reader builds `[None] * n`). Global indices cannot express "absent" separately from "empty". Every consumer in the tree already treated the two identically — and the Abaqus writer's `len(v[ic])` would in fact have raised on a genuine `None`.

One sharp edge, shared with the old model: indices are captured against the mesh's blocks *at the time you set them*. Appending a cell block is safe; inserting, removing or reordering one invalidates them.

## The format matrix

| Format | `point` | `cell` | `side` | `tag` | Notes |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| **abaqus** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | `*NSET` / `*ELSET` / `*SURFACE`. Abaqus names its groups but has no integer id for them. |
| **gmsh 2.2** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | A physical group is a named, tagged, per-dimension group of *elements*. No node-set and no side-set concept. |
| **gmsh 4.1** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Membership lives in `$Entities`, which describes the *geometry* — so it round-trips (since v9.7.0) for a mesh that says which entity each node belongs to, i.e. one carrying `point_data["gmsh:dim_tags"]`, as any mesh read from a 4.1 file does. A mesh that came from another format has no entity structure to write, so no `$Entities` is emitted and only the group *names* survive; write 2.2 for that case. |
| **exodus** | 📖 | 📖 | 📖 | ✅ | **Read only** (v8.6.0): element blocks → `cell`, node sets → `point`, side sets → `side`, each tagged with its `eb_prop1`/`ns_prop1`/`ss_prop1` id. The writer emits neither `eb_names` nor side sets, so nothing written comes back. See [`doc/formats/exodus.md`](./formats/exodus.md#named-regions). |
| **med** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | A MED family (`FAS/NOEUD`/`FAS/ELEME`) is a named group of nodes/elements — one region per group *name*, a multi-group family contributing to all of its names. A family id is per unique *combination* of names rather than per name, and a name may span several ids, so the format-native `tag` is not carried. MED has no facet-group concept, so side regions are dropped. See [`doc/formats/med.md`](./formats/med.md#named-regions). |

📖 = read only. Exodus is a region *source* rather than a round-trip target, so it is recorded in `tests/python/test_region_roundtrip.py`'s `READ_ONLY_REGIONS` rather than as a row in the round-trip matrix — that matrix writes and reads back, and a format that cannot write cannot round-trip.

Deferred to Phase 2, and listed in `tests/python/test_region_roundtrip.py` so the gap stays on the record: **UNV** and **Ansys** (absorbing `UnvInfo`/`AnsysInfo`), **OpenFOAM** (boundary patches, which are face groups and therefore side regions), **XDMF** (Sets), and **VTU/VTP** — which have no native set concept at all, so a convention has to be chosen and documented rather than invented silently. Exodus's **writer** belongs on this list too.

### Gmsh precedence

The gmsh mapping is *derived and additive*, never authoritative:

- **Read**: regions are derived from the existing `gmsh:physical` cell_data plus the `$PhysicalNames` entries in `field_data`. Both stay exactly as they were, so every existing consumer is unaffected.
- **Write**: `field_data` and `gmsh:physical` are consulted **first**; regions only fill gaps. A mesh carrying gmsh's own metadata therefore writes byte-identical bytes, and a mesh whose groups came from another format still gets real physical groups.

A gmsh dimension-0 physical group tags `vertex` *cells*, not points, so it becomes a `"cell"` region with `dim == 0` rather than a `"point"` one.

### Abaqus face identifiers

Abaqus numbers element faces `S1`..`S6`, and that numbering is **not** meshio++'s. `C3D8`'s `S1` is the 1-2-3-4 face — local nodes `{0,1,2,3}` — which is meshio++'s face 4. The mapping is spelled out per type in both `abaqus.cpp` (`abq_face_index`) and `_abaqus.py` (`_ABAQUS_FACE_ORDER`), which are twins and must stay in step: getting it wrong yields a plausible-looking side set pointing at the wrong faces. Shell elements' `SPOS`/`SNEG` name a side rather than a facet and map to facet 0 and 1.

## How operations treat regions

| Operations | Treatment |
|---|---|
| `crop`, `split`, `merge`, `reorder`, `clean`, `partition`, `convert_cells`, `refine`, `decimate` | **Remapped** through `detail/region_remap.hpp` |
| `transform`, `smooth`, `interpolate` (the target's), the `data` operations, `attach_quality` | **Passed through** — nothing is renumbered |
| `slice`, `isosurface`, `extract_surface`, `extract_skin` | **Dropped**, with a `log::warn` naming the operation |

`merge` namespaces colliding names by source index (`0:wall`, `1:wall`), the same rule it already applies to `field_data` keys.

`detail/region_remap.hpp` is the single owner of the carry. It needs to be told which *shape* an operation's cell map is in, because they genuinely differ:

- **`Direct`** — `map[c]` is *the* output cell, or `-1`. (crop, split, clean, partition, reorder.)
- **`FirstChild`** — `map[c]` is the first of a contiguous run of children, ending at the next non-negative entry. (convert_cells' simplexify, refine, decimate.) This shape also handles 1:1 maps correctly, but `Direct` must not be replaced by it: a permutation's map is not monotone, so the "next entry" rule would invent nonsense ranges.
- **`Global`** — one flat array indexed by input *global* cell index. (merge.)

A **side** entry survives only if its cell survives *and* the facet still exists: the output cell must have the same type as the input cell, and the facet index must still be in range. Under `FirstChild` a parent's children are new cells of a subdivided or different topology, so there is no facet correspondence and side regions are dropped by name.

A region that loses every entry is still carried, as an empty group — the name is information in its own right, and that is what the per-operation Python shims did before the shared helper replaced them.

## The other language bindings

**C API** ([`doc/c_api.md`](c_api.md)) — an opaque snapshot handle:

```c
mio_regions* r = mio_regions_create(mesh);
mio_region_info info;
mio_regions_info(r, 0, &info);
int64_t count;
const int64_t* entries = mio_regions_entries(r, 0, &count);
mio_regions_free(r);

mio_mesh_add_region(mesh, "wall", MIO_REGION_SIDE, 2, -1, pairs, 4);
```

**Fortran** ([`doc/fortran.md`](fortran.md)) — `m%regions(keys=, entries=)` and `m%add_region(...)`. Point and cell indices are shifted to Fortran's 1-based convention by the copying getter; the *facet* column of a side region is not, matching the `partition_labels` rule that a value which is not an index stays as it is.

**WebAssembly** ([`doc/wasm.md`](wasm.md)) — regions ride on the mesh object, so `readMesh` / `writeMesh` / `convert` carry them with no new call:

```js
const mesh = mio.readMesh('/in.inp');
mesh.regions; // [{ name, kind, dim, tag, entries }]
```

**Native CLI** — `meshioplusplus info` prints `Point sets:` / `Cell sets:` / `Side sets:`, and `meshioplusplus diff` reports regions added, removed and changed, folding them into its nonzero exit code. (`meshes_equal` deliberately does **not** consider them: it is documented to compare geometry and data.)

## Enumerating and splitting by region

Two things build directly on the model above, both added in v8.7.0:

- **`read_metadata(...)["regions"]`** (Python; `readMetadata(...).regions` in WASM; `mio_read_metadata_num_regions`/`_region_name`/`_region_info` in the C API; `mio_metadata%regions` in Fortran; the equivalent shape in Julia/R) — each region's `name`/`kind`/`dim`/`tag`/`num_entries`, **without the entries themselves**. Populated from whatever's already on an in-memory mesh, so it costs nothing extra whenever the summary came from a fallback read (every format lacking a native metadata path, plus Exodus, which always falls back); empty on the VTU/VTP/XDMF native metadata paths, since none of those map regions at all. **Gmsh 4.1's native path does report them** (since v9.7.0): `$Entities` and `$PhysicalNames` are both small and both precede `$Elements`, so the group names, dimensions, tags and entry counts come out of the block headers alone, and the summary agrees with a real read. This is what lets a caller build a SubModelPart tree — or just decide whether it's worth reading the mesh at all — without paying for a full read first.
- **`meshioplusplus regions FILE`** (both CLIs) lists the same summary directly (`--json` for machine consumption):

  ```bash
  meshioplusplus regions bracket.inp
  # <meshio++ mesh regions> (2)
  #   fixed (point, 12 entries, tag=1)
  #   solid (cell, 340 entries, dim=3, tag=2)
  ```

- **`split(mesh, by="regions")`** (see [`doc/split.md`](split.md)) turns each named `Cell` region into its own submesh — the natural next step after listing them. Unlike every other `split` criterion this is not a partition: regions may overlap, so a cell can land in zero, one, or several output pieces; `Point`/`Side` regions produce no piece, since there is no sound default for "these facets alone".

## Nested groups: the `/` convention

Regions are flat — a `Region` has a name, not a parent. Formats with genuinely nested groups (Kratos SubModelParts, and MDPA's nested `Begin SubModelPart`) therefore **flatten the path into the name with `/`**:

```
Structure/Loads/PointLoad3D
```

This is a convention, not a parser: the region is one name that happens to contain slashes, and it round-trips as such. The KRATOS mesh backend is the one place that interprets it — `BuildSubModelPartsFromRegions` splits on `/` and walks or creates the chain, adding members to the leaf, and `RestoreRegions` walks the tree back into the same flattened names.

`.` is **reserved** and cannot appear in a segment: `ModelPart::FullName()` joins ancestors with it. A region name containing one is left on the mesh but not materialized as a SubModelPart, with a warning — the same treatment `Side` regions already get. This is the exact interaction MED's own Kratos `MedApplication` runs into: it uses `.` as *its* group-name nesting separator when writing MED family names from Kratos, so a MED file carrying such a name round-trips its region unaffected through every mesh backend except KRATOS's SubModelPart materialization, which — per this rule — leaves it flat with a warning rather than guessing at the intended nesting.

One thing a SubModelPart cannot carry back is a region's `mDim`/`mTag`: it stores a name and member ids and nothing else. A region reconstructed from one reports `-1` for both unless a staged region of the same name and kind supplied them. That is the truthful answer rather than a gap — synthesizing a value would be inventing data.
