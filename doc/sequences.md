# Sequences: multi-file and transient datasets

Since v9.12.0 meshio++ can treat a **set of files** — or the steps inside one multi-step file — as one ordered logical dataset. That is how transient solver output actually arrives (`out_0000.vtu … out_0500.vtu`), and how most of the 43 formats have to express time, since only a minority carry several steps natively.

```bash
# fan-in: N single-step files -> one multi-step XDMF (quote the glob!)
meshioplusplus convert 'out_*.vtu' series.xdmf

# fan-out: one multi-step file -> one file per step
meshioplusplus convert series.xdmf 'step_{step}.vtu'

# a whole transient post-processing run, chain applied per step
meshioplusplus pipeline transient.json
```

```python
import meshioplusplus as mp

for time, mesh in mp.read_sequence("out_*.vtu"):   # lazy: one mesh at a time
    print(time, mesh.points.shape)

mp.write_sequence("series.xdmf", mp.read_sequence("out_*.vtu"))
```

## It is a driver, not an operation

Everything here reads and writes through the existing format registry and runs operation chains through the existing **typed pipeline layer**. `run_pipeline_steps` remains the single owner of the step dispatch — there is deliberately no second `if (op == ...)` chain — so a sequence document and the browser viewer's `convertSurfaceOps` still cannot drift apart. Nothing here adds a mesh operation, a file format, or a dependency.

## The three shapes

| input expands to | output has `{step}`/`{index}` | mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1 file, 1 step | no | `sequence` (degenerate — identical to a plain single-file run) |
| 1 file, >1 step | yes | `fan-out` |
| 1 file, >1 step | no | **error** — refuses to truncate |
| >1 files | no | `fan-in` |
| >1 files | yes | `sequence` (N→N) |
| 1 file, 1 step | yes | `sequence` with one entry |

The mode is **inferred**. An explicit `Mode` (`"sequence"`, `"fan-in"`, `"fan-out"`) never *changes* the run: it **asserts** the inference and errors naming both on a mismatch. That is worth having because the inference depends on how many files a glob happened to match — a pattern matching exactly one file would otherwise quietly take the single-file path, and someone who wrote `"Mode": "fan-in"` wants that to fail.

## Ordering is natural-numeric

A sequence has a defined order and it is **not lexicographic**: `out_10.vtu` must follow `out_9.vtu`, which a plain sort gets backwards. The rule is a documented contract, not an implementation detail:

1. Both strings split into maximal runs of digits and maximal runs of non-digits, compared run by run.
2. Two non-digit runs compare byte by byte as **unsigned** bytes — plain `char` signedness is implementation-defined, and would order the same UTF-8 paths differently on ARM than on x86.
3. Two digit runs compare **numerically**: leading zeros stripped, a shorter stripped run is less, equal lengths compare lexicographically. This is done on the digits themselves and never through `stoull`/`int()`, so a 40-digit hash-named file cannot overflow.
4. A digit run at the same position as a non-digit run sorts **first**.
5. If every run compares equal, the **unstripped** strings compare byte-wise, so `out_1` < `out_01` deterministically.
6. The **whole path** is compared, not the basename, so `a/out_9` < `a/out_10` < `b/out_1`.

Rule 5 is not cosmetic: without it `out_1` and `out_01` are mutually "not less" yet not equivalent, which makes the comparator not a strict weak ordering and `std::sort` undefined behaviour on any directory mixing padded and unpadded names. `tests/cpp/test_sequence.cpp` brute-forces all four axioms over a table containing exactly that case.

An **explicit path list** is a stated order and is *not* re-sorted; pass `sort=True` (Python) / `opts.sort` (C) to sort it anyway. A pattern is always sorted, since a directory listing has no meaningful order of its own.

## The pattern language

Exactly `*` (any run, possibly empty) and `?` (exactly one character). **No `**`, no `[set]`, no brace expansion**, and the directory component of a pattern is taken **literally** — a `*` there is an error naming the restriction rather than a recursive walk nobody asked for.

This is deliberately narrower than POSIX `glob(3)` *and* than Python's `glob`/`fnmatch`. Matching lives in the C++ core, so the native CLI, the C API, Fortran, Julia and R all get it; the Python twin re-implements the same restricted matcher rather than delegating to `fnmatch`, precisely so the two cannot accept different things. `[abc]` is three literal characters here.

### Shell quoting

**Quote the pattern.** A shell expands `out_*.vtu` before the CLI ever sees it, so `convert out_*.vtu out.xdmf` reaches the CLI as a dozen positional arguments and fails on the argument count. Two forms work:

```bash
meshioplusplus convert 'out_*.vtu' out.xdmf                       # quoted
meshioplusplus convert a.vtu --input b.vtu --input c.vtu out.xdmf  # pre-expanded
```

`--input` appends to the positional `infile` and is repeatable — it is what to reach for when your shell (or your build system) has already expanded the glob. Both forms produce the same dataset.

`--no-sequence` forces the single-file path, for the rare filename that genuinely contains `*` or `{step}` (legal on POSIX). `--sequence` forces the sequence path.

## Time values

Every entry carries a time and a record of **which source it came from**, because "the file said 0.25" and "nothing said anything, so this is position 3" are different facts and a user plotting against it needs to know which they have. The precedence:

| priority | source | reported as | where it comes from |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | explicit | `explicit` | the caller's own list (`Times` / `times=`) |
| 2 | file | `file` | a multi-step file's own step time, or a single-step file's `field_data["meshio:time"]` |
| 3 | filename | `filename` | the **last** maximal digit run of the stem, so `run17/out_0042.vtu` gives 42 |
| 4 | index | `index` | the integer position — the fallback, with a warning carrying the count |

`time_from` (`"auto"` by default) restricts this: `"file"`, `"filename"` and `"index"` each pin one source, falling back to the index when it says nothing.

An explicit list whose length does not match the entry count is an error naming both counts.

### `field_data["meshio:time"]`

A length-1 Float64 array holding the one time a mesh is a snapshot at. It generalizes the `exodus:time` convention the Exodus reader/writer already round-trips, and is colon-namespaced like `partition:part` because a bare `"time"` would collide with a solver's own field far too often.

**It only survives where the target format carries `field_data` at all**, which today means Exodus, Gmsh and MDPA — VTU, VTK and most others carry none in either direction. So a fan-out to `out_{step}.vtu` followed by a fan-in recovers the step *index* from the filename, not the original time value, and the entry reports `filename` so you can see that. To close such a round trip on time, supply the times on the way back in:

```python
mp.write_sequence("series.xdmf", mp.read_sequence("step_*.vtu"), )   # times from filenames
mp.write_sequence("series.xdmf",
                  mp.read_sequence("step_*.vtu", times=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2]))
```

A fan-in to XDMF needs no help: the series records its own step times, and a later `sequence_entries` on it reports `file`.

## `{step}` and `{index}`

`{index}` is the plain decimal index. `{step}` is that index zero-padded to `max(4, digits(count - 1))`, so a 12-step run writes `out_0000 … out_0011` and a 20000-step run widens to `out_00005` rather than sorting wrongly in a directory listing.

Expansion is **substring replacement**, not `str.format`: an unrelated `{` in the path is a literal. This matches the native CLI's existing `{key}`/`{part}` helpers for `split` and `partition`, and differs from the *Python* CLI's `str.format`-based versions of those, which raise on a stray brace. That asymmetry is pre-existing; these tokens inherit the C++ side's semantics rather than introducing a third convention. (The three expanders are deliberately kept separate: `split`'s and `partition`'s output must stay byte-identical, and because the two languages differ a "shared" helper would be two helpers anyway.)

## Which formats carry time

Two different questions, answered two different ways:

**Reading** — how many steps does this file have? — is **registry-derived**: `read_metadata(...).time_values`. A format whose metadata reader fills no time values has one step, which is the truthful answer for every format that cannot express time. Today **XDMF** and **Exodus** report real counts.

> **Known gap: MED.** MED honours `time_step` in the C++ core but has no entry in `registry_metadata_readers()`, so there is no count to read and a multi-step `.med` reports one step. Probing it would cost a full read and still report one, so it is deliberately excluded from the probe list. This closes for free the moment `read_med_metadata` fills `mTimeValues` — no change to the sequence layer required.

**Writing** — can this format hold N steps? — has no file to probe, so it is a small owned predicate: **XDMF only**. The anti-drift mechanism is a test rather than the table: a gtest iterates every registered writer and asserts the predicate agrees with whether a real two-step fan-in to that format actually succeeds, so a format that grows a series writer without updating the predicate turns CI red naming itself.

**Fan-out is the answer for everything else**, which is most of the 43 formats.

## Never a silent truncation

A multi-step input aimed at a single-step output is an **error naming the remedy**, not a quiet write of step 0:

```
meshio++: sequence: the input has 12 time steps but the output path 'one.vtu'
names a single file; add '{step}' to write one file per step, or select a
single step (--time-step on the CLI, Input.Options.TimeStep in a settings
document)
```

and a fan-in to a format that cannot hold a series:

```
meshio++: sequence: format 'vtu' cannot hold a multi-step series (only 'xdmf'
can); write one file per step with an Output path containing '{step}' instead
```

An explicit `--time-step` / `Input.Options.TimeStep` **is** a deliberate single-step selection and opts out of the check. Before v9.12.0, `convert series.xdmf out.vtu` silently wrote the first step.

## The streaming guarantee

> At most **one** `Mesh` is alive at any point inside a fan-in, a fan-out or a per-step run, and `read_sequence` yields at most one live mesh per iteration.

This is a **contract, not an optimization** — the whole feature exists so a 500-step dataset is traversable on a laptop. No implementation may buffer the sequence, including "just for sorting" or "just to compute the time range": expansion returns the *plan* (paths, step indices and times), never meshes.

It is pinned rather than asserted in prose. A gtest measures the peak through the `BufferAllocator` hook and requires it to be **O(1) in the step count** (the real assertion is that the 40-file peak matches the 20-file one, not that either is small); the Python suite uses weak references, so a regression names the retainer rather than merely being slow.

The C ABI expresses the same rule: `mio_sequence_read` hands back an **owned** mesh, deliberately unlike `mio_split_result_mesh`'s borrow, because a borrow would force the handle to cache every mesh it produced.

**What does not stream**: `list(read_sequence(...))` is your choice and your memory, and an operation's own internals are unchanged — a single step that does not fit in memory still does not fit.

## Holding a series as one value: `TimeSeries`

`read_sequence` is a **generator**: exhausted after one pass, unable to answer `len(...)`, unable to be indexed. That is deliberate — it is the surface for a single streaming traversal. But the C/Fortran/Julia/R sequence handles (`mio_sequence`, `type(mio_sequence)`, `Sequence`, `mio_sequence()`) already give **random access** by construction: they hold the entry *plan* and read step *i* on demand, any number of times, in any order. Python had no equivalent — until `TimeSeries`:

```python
series = mp.TimeSeries("out_*.vtu")
len(series)                  # 12, from the plan alone -- no reads
series.times                 # [0.0, 1.0, ..., 11.0], likewise
t0, mesh0 = series[0]        # exactly one read
t_last, mesh_last = series[-1]
for t, mesh in series:       # a fresh, independent pass every time
    ...
```

It closes the one item [`doc/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) had left open for this feature: a caller that genuinely needs to *hold* a series — random access across steps, more than one pass — no longer has to reach for `list(...)`. It still honours the streaming invariant: only the plan is held, never a mesh, so `series[i]` performs exactly one read and nothing is cached between accesses — holding a 500-entry `TimeSeries` costs no more memory than holding its plan.

## Sequences in a settings document

The v9.11.0 pipeline schema, plus seven keys. See [the settings pipeline](pipeline.md) for everything else.

```jsonc
{
  "Version": 1,
  "Mode": "sequence",                 // optional: asserts the inferred shape
  "Input": {
    "Pattern": "run/out_*.vtu",       // or "Paths": [...], or "Path": "in.xdmf"
    "Times": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2],         // optional explicit times
    "TimeFrom": "auto",               // auto | file | filename | index
    "Format": "vtu",
    "Options": { "PointsOnly": false }
  },
  "Operations": [                     // applied to EVERY step
    { "Op": "Quality" },
    { "Op": "Gradient", "Array": "temperature" }
  ],
  "Output": { "Path": "post/out_{step}.vtu" },
  "Parallel": true,                   // Python driver only
  "Workers": 8
}
```

`Path`, `Pattern` and `Paths` are mutually exclusive; naming more than one is an error. Parsing stays strict everywhere: an unknown key, op or enum value errors naming it.

**Backward compatibility is absolute.** A document using none of the new keys and naming a plain output takes a physically unchanged path — the C++ engine literally delegates to `run_pipeline`. Conversely, `parse_pipeline_json` (the typed single-file parser) **rejects** a sequence key by name rather than ignoring it, because ignoring one would run a transient document as its first step.

### `Parallel` / `Workers`

Files are embarrassingly parallel at the driver level, so the **Python** driver can run them in a `ProcessPoolExecutor` (`Workers` defaults to one per core). Output is identical to the serial run, report included.

Two deliberate restrictions:

- **`Parallel` with a fan-in is an error**, not a silent serialization. The series writer is one stateful handle whose steps must be appended in order, and the obvious workaround — parallel reads feeding an ordered queue into one writer — would hold `Workers + 1` meshes and break the streaming guarantee. If that trade is ever worth making it should be an explicit, named opt-in with its memory cost stated.
- **The C++ engine runs serially** and records a warning when a document asks for parallelism. Every operation already parallelizes internally, so a step-level parallel region nested over them would oversubscribe on every backend.

## Per-surface entry points

| Surface | Call |
|---|---|
| Python CLI | `meshioplusplus convert 'in_*.vtu' out.xdmf`, `… in.xdmf 'out_{step}.vtu'`, `meshioplusplus pipeline settings.json` |
| Native CLI | the same words |
| Python | `read_sequence`, `write_sequence`, `sequence_entries`, `run_sequence_pipeline`, `TimeSeries` (and `run_pipeline`, which routes here) |
| C | `mio_sequence_open`/`_open_list`/`_count`/`_path`/`_step`/`_time`/`_time_source`/`_read`/`_free`, `mio_sequence_to_timeseries`/`_ex`, `mio_timeseries_to_sequence`, `mio_sequence_pipeline_run_file`/`_json` |
| Fortran | `type(mio_sequence)` with `%open`/`%count`/`%path`/`%time`/`%read_step`/`%to_timeseries`/`%free`, plus `mio_timeseries_to_sequence` |
| Julia | `Sequence`, `read_step`, `to_timeseries`, `timeseries_to_sequence`, `run_sequence_file`/`_json` |
| R | `mio_sequence()`, `mio_sequence_read()`, `mio_sequence_to_timeseries()`, `mio_timeseries_to_sequence()`, … |
| MCP | the `sequence` tool |
| WASM | `sequenceEntries`, `sequenceToTimeseries`, `timeseriesToSequence`, and `runPipeline` (which routes) — over MEMFS paths |

### WASM

The browser surface has these too, over MEMFS paths — the same filesystem `convert` and `runPipeline` already work on:

```js
m.sequenceEntries('/seq/out_*.vtu');                      // the ordered plan
m.sequenceToTimeseries('/seq/out_*.vtu', '/seq/s.xdmf');  // fan-in
m.timeseriesToSequence('/seq/s.xdmf', '/seq/b_{step}.vtu');  // fan-out -> paths
```

`Parallel` is accepted and **ignored with a warning** there: it is a Python-driver process pool, and a wasm module has no processes to pool. See [the WASM docs](wasm.md#sequences-transient--multi-file-datasets).

## Worked examples

### Convert a directory of steps into one time series

```bash
meshioplusplus convert 'results/out_*.vtu' results/series.xdmf
```

Reads the twelve `out_0.vtu … out_11.vtu` in natural-numeric order (so `out_10` follows `out_9`), takes each time from the trailing digit run of its filename, and streams them into one temporal XDMF collection — one mesh in memory at a time, whatever the step count.

### A transient post-processing run

`transient.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": 1,
  "Input": { "Pattern": "raw/out_*.vtu" },
  "Operations": [
    { "Op": "Quality" },
    { "Op": "Gradient", "Array": "temperature", "Operator": "gradient" },
    { "Op": "Clean" }
  ],
  "Output": { "Path": "post/out_{step}.vtu" },
  "Parallel": true
}
```

```bash
meshioplusplus pipeline transient.json
```

Every step is read, run through the same three-operation chain, and written to its own file — the composition that turns the pipeline into a batch post-processor. The report carries one entry per (step, op).

### Explode a multi-step file for a tool that cannot read one

```bash
meshioplusplus convert simulation.xdmf 'steps/frame_{step}.vtu'
```

Writes `steps/frame_0000.vtu …`, each carrying its own `field_data["meshio:time"]` where the target format can hold it.
