# meshio++ roadmap

Status at time of writing: **v10.29.0** — 43 formats, thirty-four mesh operations + five data operations, six language surfaces (Python / C / Fortran / Julia / R / WASM), two viewers plus a browser dataset manager, a Blender add-on, an MCP server, a settings-driven pipeline engine, a dataset-manifest layer with a PhysicsNeMo adapter, and a versioned ABI (`MESHIOPLUSPLUS_ABI_VERSION` 11).

This document lists what is *not* built. Items are grouped by theme, each with an effort estimate and the reason it matters. Nothing here duplicates shipped functionality; where a feature partially exists, the gap is stated explicitly.

Effort key: **S** = days, **M** = a couple of weeks, **L** = a month or more, **XL** = a project in its own right.

## 1. Physics-ML data paths beyond graphs

**The gap.** meshio++ has one complete path into a physics-ML framework, and it is the *graph* one: [`graph_sample`](ml.md) builds nodes, edges, features and targets from a mesh's own connectivity, [`DatasetManifest`](datasets.md) catalogues the solves, [`run_training`](physicsnemo.md) fits a MeshGraphNet from a `TrainSpec`, and the [dashboard](dashboard.md) launches and follows the run. Every *other* shape a physics-ML model wants — a regular grid, a point cloud under a token budget, a proximity graph, a temporal window — has to be assembled by hand from the pieces, and some of the pieces do not exist. The [PhysicsNeMo basics](physicsnemo/overview.md) section is the map of what a model on the other side actually expects.

**Where to port from.** Most of this exists, working and tested, in the Kratos `PhysicsNeMoApplication` (`applications/PhysicsNeMoApplication`, tracking physicsnemo 2.2), written against the same concepts and by the same author. It is the reference implementation to copy each item from rather than re-derive; the flow is expected to run the other way afterwards, with that application consuming meshio++ instead of carrying its own mesh layer. Nothing below needs C++, WASM or a binding change — this is all a Python data layer over operations the core already has.

- **Point-cloud budgets** — farthest-point sampling, subsampling and bounding-box filters, so a large surface cloud fits a transformer's token budget. `feature_matrix` already produces the node table these models want; nothing reduces it to a fixed size. **S**
- **Proximity graphs** — radius and k-nearest-neighbour neighbourhoods with a periodic minimum-image mode, multiscale (bistride) hierarchies, and "world" edges alongside the mesh edges. [`edge_index`](ml.md) builds a graph from mesh edges or the cell dual only, which is exactly wrong for particles, where the interaction radius and not the connectivity is what defines a neighbour. **M**
- **Curved tessellation and a provenance map** — isoparametric subdivision of higher-order cells through synthetic points on a refinement lattice, interpolated on the way in and dropped on the way back; and a map from each simplex to the cell it came from, so a prediction made on a tetrahedron is written onto the hexahedron it was carved out of. [`convert_cells(simplexify)`](convert_cells.md) already splits conformingly (its hexahedron diagonal is fixed rather than chosen per cell, which is what makes neighbours agree); neither of the other two exists. **M**
- **Formats a physics-ML pipeline expects** — `.pmsh` (memory-mapped, measured upstream at 20–135x faster loads than VTU and 2–7x smaller), the CAE `.npz` sample layout, OpenUSD, and Zarr mesh I/O. `.pmsh` is the one a training loop genuinely misses, since it is what the framework's own `MeshDataset` reads. **M**
- **Temporal windowing datasets** — single-step, time-conditional and one-shot windows over a [`TimeSeries`](sequences.md), plus rollout evaluation (feed a prediction back in and measure the drift). `target_offset` pairs step k with step k+n, which is the first of those three and none of the rest. **S**
- **Dataset-level augmentation** — [`transform(rotate_vector_data=True)`](transform.md) already rotates vector and rank-2 tensor fields coherently, which is the part upstream's own transforms get wrong. What is missing is only the wrapper: per-epoch, seeded, applied to a whole manifest. **S**
- **Geometry guardrails** — out-of-distribution detection on the *shape* rather than on any field, over non-invariant surface descriptors. Unusually well suited to this library: `compute_stats`, `compute_quality` and `extract_surface` already produce every descriptor, `dataset_health` already summarizes a manifest, and fitting a density over those summaries is a small amount of code on top. The descriptors must stay non-invariant, which is the opposite of the usual instinct — a scaled part is a different part. **S**
- **Mesh operations physicsnemo has and meshio++ does not expose** — per-vertex mean and Gaussian curvature as a node feature (computed inside [`remesh`](remesh.md)'s gradation path but not public, and a natural companion to the signed distance), mesh repair beyond [`clean`](clean.md), shrinkwrap, and Sobolev deformation. **S**
- **Second model families** — the 2-D operators (FNO, AFNO) through the thin-axis squeeze idiom, and DeepONet for parameters-in/field-out, which is the shape a great many engineering problems actually have and the one people reach for a neural operator for by mistake. Both follow the grid path above rather than preceding it. **M**

**Deliberately not.** Assembled solver residuals, adjoints and Sobolev training, co-simulation, active-learning *labeling*, adaptive remeshing driven by a surrogate, and MPI model-part gathering. Every one needs a live solver — an assembly routine, its tangent, its communicator — and meshio++ has no notion of a discrete system. They belong in the application that owns the solver, which is precisely the division [Symbolic and physics](physicsnemo/symbolic_and_physics.md) describes.

---

## 2. Scale

The benchmark is a ~52k-node bracket; nothing addresses meshes that do not fit in RAM.

- **A large-mesh benchmark tier** (10M+ cells) — cheap, and it would show whether the parallel paths actually hold. Do this before the two below, since it decides whether they matter. **S**
- **Streaming / chunked writes**, the counterpart to the selective-read work. **L**
- **Out-of-core operations** for the ops that are already block-local. **XL**

---

## 3. Ecosystem reach

- **Rust bindings** over the C API — the next language by scientific adoption after Julia/R, and the ABI/`SOVERSION` work makes it cheap. **M**
- **Registration and distribution** — conda-forge, CRAN, Julia General, the Blender Extensions Platform, a proper ParaView reader plugin. All deferred at binding time; all pure logistics, and all blocking real adoption. The Blender extension zips are built and attached to every `v*` release (see `doc/blender.md`), so only the *listing* remains there. **M**

*The Blender add-on shipped in v10.21.0 and has been removed from this section: `src/python/meshioplusplus/_blender.py` (the pure payload layer plus `to_blender`/`from_blender`), the 4.2+ extension in `src/blender/`, and per-platform zips on every release. See [`doc/blender.md`](blender.md).*

---

## 4. Quality of implementation

- **Fuzzing the readers** (libFuzzer / AFL, OSS-Fuzz if it will take the project). 42 mostly hand-rolled parsers, reachable from a C ABI, a browser and an MCP server — untrusted input reaches them by design. The highest-value non-feature item in this document. **M**
- **A format conformance matrix** — one canonical mesh written to and read back from every format, with declared per-format lossiness, generalising the region round-trip test into executable documentation of what survives what. **M**
- **Property-based testing** (Hypothesis) over the invariants already articulated in the docs: partition-of-unity, volume conservation, conformity, byte-identical determinism. **M**

---

## 5. NURBS and higher-order geometry (long run)

**The gap.** The data model is strictly linear/Lagrange polytopes: a `CellBlock` is a cell-type string plus a node-index array. NURBS is a genuinely different object — control points, weights, knot vectors, and a parametric mapping — and CAD/IGA formats (STEP, IGES, Rhino 3dm, `.iga`) express geometry that no current cell type can hold. This is the most architecturally invasive item on the list and should be approached as a research spike, not a feature.

- **Spike: how far can the current model stretch?** Higher-order Lagrange cells already exist (`hexahedron27`, VTK-Lagrange types); a rational Bézier/NURBS patch needs *weights* and a *knot vector*, which have nowhere to live. Determine whether a side-channel struct (the `MedInfo`/`GmshInfo` precedent) suffices, or whether the `Mesh` needs a genuine second entity kind. Write the finding up before committing. **M**
- **Read-only CAD ingestion first**: a NURBS surface tessellated to a triangle mesh at a requested tolerance, with the parametric data carried out-of-band. This delivers most of the practical value (getting CAD into the mesh world) without touching the data model, and is the natural first release. **L**
- **A real IGA data model** — patches, control nets, weights, knots, trimming curves — plus formats and evaluation. This is XL, likely a separate library or a major version, and should only be attempted if the spike shows real demand.
- **Dependency reality**: robust STEP/IGES parsing effectively means OpenCASCADE, which is a heavyweight LGPL dependency. If ingestion goes ahead, it must follow the KaHIP/Polyscope pattern — strictly optional, off by default, never in the core, licence implications documented. **Findings before code.**

*Recommended posture: spike and document; do not schedule implementation until the spike says what shape it takes.*

---

## 6. Mesh generation

**The gap.** Every operation transforms a mesh you already have; nothing creates one. This is the only empty category in the operations layer — **partly closed as a side effect of `remesh_volume`'s own delivery** (v10.13.0), which accepts a closed surface directly and generates a genuinely new tetrahedral volume mesh (isosurface stuffing over a BCC lattice) rather than transforming the input's own cells; a surface-in/volume-out capability this section previously lacked entirely. It does not close any bullet below, though: no primitive constructors, no extrude/revolve, and no 2D output (it is a 3D volume mesher, not a 2D triangulator) — those gaps stand as stated.

- **Primitive constructors** — `box`, `sphere`, `cylinder`, `disk`. (`grid(nx,ny,nz)` shipped in v9.24.0 as part of the signed-distance work, over the same `detail/grid_lattice.hpp`; the rest follow the same shape.) Trivial, dependency-free, and it removes the fixture-file dependency from tests, docs, notebooks, the browser demo and the MCP server. Highest leverage per line of code in this document. **S**
- **`extrude`** — 2D → 3D sweep (triangle→wedge, quad→hexahedron), `nlayers`, per-layer offsets. The most-requested generation primitive; repeatedly deferred. **M**
- **`revolve`** — extrude's rotational sibling, sweeping around an axis. **M**
- **Delaunay / constrained 2D meshing** — genuinely useful, but robust geometric predicates are where dependency-free stops paying. Better as an optional Triangle or Gmsh backend, following the KaHIP pattern. **L**

---

## 7. CLI chatbot / conversational assistant (MCP-driven)

**The gap.** The MCP server (`src/python/meshioplusplus/mcp/`, `doc/mcp.md`) exposes the whole Python surface to an AI *agent* — but only to one already speaking MCP over stdio (Claude Desktop, an IDE, a custom host). There is no way to have a natural-language conversation about a mesh **from the terminal itself**: a user with an LLM API key on hand cannot ask `meshioplusplus` "why does this file fail to convert" or "clean this mesh and tell me what changed" and get a tool-calling assistant that drives the existing operations for them. Every other surface (Python API, CLI verbs, MCP tools) is imperative-only; this is the one conversational entry point missing.

- **Minimal REPL verb**: a `meshioplusplus chat` command (Python CLI only, `_cli/_chat.py`, alongside `data`/`dataset` as a third nested concern) that starts a terminal chat loop. Gated cleanly on an LLM API key being present (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` first-class, matching the `claude-api` skill's model; provider-agnostic wiring behind the same interface is a stretch goal, not a v1 requirement) — absent, it fails by name (`pip install meshioplusplus[chat]` / "set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"), the `meshioplusplus-mcp` entry-point precedent, never a bare traceback. **S–M**
- **Reuse, not reimplementation**: the assistant's tool-calling loop drives `mcp/_tools.py`'s existing `TOOL_REGISTRY` directly (in-process, no stdio round trip needed for a same-process CLI) — never a second copy of the tool dispatch, sandbox (`_resolve`), or `_json_safe` result-sanitizing logic MCP already owns. A new tool added to `TOOL_REGISTRY` is automatically available to the chatbot for free, the same parity guarantee `test_every_operation_has_a_tool` already gives the MCP surface. **M** (mostly wiring an agentic loop over an existing, stable tool registry — see the `claude-api` skill for the Messages API tool-use shape)
- **Scope for v1**: a stateless-per-turn loop (send message + conversation history + tool schemas from `TOOL_REGISTRY`, execute any tool calls the model requests, feed results back, repeat until a plain-text reply) operating on files under the CWD or an explicit `--root`, mirroring the MCP server's own path sandbox rather than inventing a second one. Multi-turn context lives only in the terminal session; no persistence, no server. **S**
- **New optional extra**: `chat = ["anthropic>=0.40,<1"]` (the SDK, not a hard dependency of `meshioplusplus` itself — the `mcp` extra's precedent), kept out of `[all]`. `_tools.py` stays untouched (no SDK import); only the new `_cli/_chat.py` / a `mcp/_chat.py` module imports it, so the default CI matrix and every other surface are unaffected. **S**
- **Docs**: a `doc/chat.md` page (modelled on `doc/mcp.md`) and a CLAUDE.md entry once shipped, per the "Keeping docs in sync" rule at the top of this file.

*Recommended posture: this is a thin client over work that already exists (the MCP tool registry) rather than new mesh functionality — the honest estimate for a usable v1 is small (S–M), with provider-agnostic support and a persisted chat history as documented follow-ups rather than v1 requirements.*

## Suggested sequencing

1. **Remeshing — shipped in full**, removed from this document entirely: v10.10.0 (`remesh`, a clean-room isotropic clustering engine derived from the MIT `pyvista/pyacvd` plus an original `metric="quadric"` synthesis over meshio++'s own pre-existing Garland-Heckbert quadric machinery, across every binding surface in one release); v10.11.0 (curvature gradation via a new osculating-paraboloid vertex-curvature estimator, plus boundary pinning/dual-edge insertion and separately-reported non-manifold-vertex detection, both extending `remesh` and its full binding surface); v10.12.0 (`metric="anisotropic"`, packing a curvature tensor into the existing quadric accumulator, closing the section's L estimate faster than expected once gradation had already supplied the curvature machinery it needed — `MESHIOPLUSPLUS_ABI_VERSION` 8→9); v10.13.0 (`remesh_volume`, isosurface stuffing over a BCC lattice, closing the volumetric bullet's *capability* by a predicate-free algorithm rather than the literal Delaunay/CVD method named, plus `SmoothMethod::Odt` closing its "ODT" half's *smoothing* piece on fixed connectivity — `MESHIOPLUSPLUS_ABI_VERSION` 9→10, not because either operation's own new option/result struct needed it, but because `SmoothMethod` gaining an explicit `: std::uint8_t` underlying type for the first time is itself a Tier A layout change under `doc/abi.md`'s own rule); v10.14.0 (`optimize_volume`, closing the "ODT" bullet's *remeshing* piece — predicate-free 2-3/3-2 topological flips alternated with the ODT vertex relocation, genuinely changing connectivity, Tier C additive with no ABI bump, full binding surface in one release). See `doc/remesh.md`, `doc/remesh_volume.md` and `doc/optimize_volume.md`.
2. **Provenance in written files** — shipped in full and removed from this document: v10.15.0 (the audit-and-normalize bullet — one canonical, engine-identical credit line, plus the per-format comment-syntax table in `doc/formats.md#provenance`), v10.16.0 (the opt-in record — source/target, operation chain, conversion assumptions, timestamp, over a thread-local scope with a Python↔C++ bridge, and the `mio_provenance_*` C ABI), v10.17.0 (read-back through `read_metadata`/`info`, plus the Fortran/Julia/R/WASM bindings — `MESHIOPLUSPLUS_ABI_VERSION` 10→11, since `MeshMetadata` grew two fields). Widening conversion-assumption coverage past the wired formats is a documented follow-up in `doc/provenance.md`, not a roadmap gap. See `doc/provenance.md`.
3. **GiD postprocess — shipped in full and removed from this document**: v10.18.0 (vendoring, build integration, all three write flavours, extension dispatch, every registry-driven surface), v10.19.0 (the hand-rolled reader, all three flavours, plus two upstream gidpost HDF5 bug fixes its own test suite surfaced; the `hexahedron20` node-order conflict against CIMNE's own documentation resolved in Kratos's favour; `hexahedron27`/`wedge15`/`pyramid13` added by deriving their orderings from Kratos's own geometry classes; all nine `GiD_ResultType`s, including `Matrix`/`Complex*`, via a `field_data` declaration; arbitrary Gauss points per element; `ResultGroup` reading; the `ascii_zipped` write mode; and multi-step series in both directions, including `Group`/`OnGroup` re-meshing), and v10.20.0 (the release CLI binaries and every published wheel gained `gid` write support via a `FetchContent`-vendored static zlib, `MESHIOPLUSPLUS_ZLIB_STATIC`, closing the section's last item). See `doc/formats/gid.md`.
4. **Primitive constructors (§6, first item)** — a few days, and it improves testing, docs and every demo surface at once. `grid` already shipped over `detail/grid_lattice.hpp`; `box`/`sphere`/`cylinder`/`disk` follow the same shape.
5. **PhysicsNeMo integration** — shipped in full and removed from this document: v9.28.0 (recon note, adapter, dataset manager, recipes, GPU-executed example), v9.29.0 (dataset-manager UI), v9.30.0 (t→t+1 target pairing, the `physicsnemo.mesh.Mesh` bridge, persisted directory handles, per-entry quality summaries). See `doc/physicsnemo.md` and `doc/datasets.md`.
6. **Remaining refinement and coarsening gaps** — shipped in full and removed from this document: v10.2.0 (error-estimator helpers — `estimate_error`), v10.3.0 (polyhedral refinement — `subdivide`), v10.4.0 (polyhedral coarsening — `agglomerate`), v10.5.0 (green-element undo — `undo_green`), v10.6.0 (volume decimation — `decimate_volume`, the section's last open item). See `doc/error.md`, `doc/subdivide.md`, `doc/agglomerate.md`, `doc/undo_green.md` and `doc/decimate_volume.md`.
7. **Field capability beyond derivatives** — shipped in full and removed from this document: v10.8.0 (field integration — `data_integrate`, a cell-measure-weighted total/mean over cells, whole-mesh and per named Cell region), v10.9.0 (second derivatives — `hessian`, a composition of two `gradient` calls, exact for a linear field everywhere and for a quadratic field away from a structured mesh's own boundary, closing the section's last open item). See `doc/field_integration.md` and `doc/hessian.md`.
8. **Fuzzing (§4)** — should start in parallel with all of the above; it is not a feature and does not compete for the same attention.
9. **NURBS spike (§5)** — a documented investigation, scheduled independently of the rest.
10. **Dataset dashboard and training integration** — shipped in full and removed from this document: v10.22.0 (the multi-dataset overview, the per-dataset drill-down, browser-side health summaries, manifest diffing), v10.23.0 (the companion process `meshioplusplus-mcp --http` and its server-side health producer), v10.24.0 (the in-package trainer, the job manager as `train_*` tools, launch and monitoring, log tailing, the checkpoint browser) and v10.25.0 (run history and comparison, in-viewer prediction preview, run-completion webhooks, and the design pass). None of it touched C++, WASM or any binding. See [`doc/dashboard.md`](dashboard.md) and [`doc/physicsnemo.md`](physicsnemo.md#training-and-prediction).
11. **Physics-ML data paths (§1)** — the grid/superresolution bullet is **shipped in full and removed**: v10.27.0 (the mesh<->grid transfer, [`doc/grids.md`](grids.md)), v10.28.0 (the dataset side — an optional `Target` pairing, `grid_sample_pair`/`iter_grid_samples`/`grid_stats`, and `GridSpec.upscale_samples`), and v10.29.0 (the `srresnet` family in `TrainSpec`, `predict` dispatching on the card, the dashboard's model selector and a GPU-executed worked example that beats the trilinear baseline 19x on RMSE and 93x on the power spectrum). The rest of the section is independent of it and of each other; **point-cloud budgets** is the natural next one, being small and self-contained.
12. **CLI chatbot (§7)** — small and self-contained (a thin client over the existing MCP tool registry); can proceed independently whenever a maintainer wants it, no sequencing dependency on anything above.
