"""The cross-format region round-trip matrix.

One fixture mesh carrying **all three** region kinds is written to and read back
from every format meshio++ can currently map regions onto, and the table below
declares what each format keeps and what it loses. The table is the point: it
makes the lossiness executable documentation rather than prose that drifts, and
a format that silently starts or stops carrying a kind fails here.

Phase 1 maps Gmsh, Abaqus and MED. Exodus reads regions (element blocks, node
sets and side sets) but does not yet write them, so it is a **read-only** entry
recorded below rather than a row here -- this matrix is a round-trip table, and
a format that cannot write cannot round-trip. UNV, Ansys, OpenFOAM and XDMF
are deferred entirely. See ``doc/regions.md``.
